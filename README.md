## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Sports predictions have always been a topic of interest, especially with the gambling portion of predicting what will happen in a game. In recent years with the increase in analytics in the MLB, the process of guessing the winner of a game has gotten much more complicated.

This is an interesting topic as there are endless factors that can change a game, although in reality it is impossible to perfectly predict exactly how players will perform on any given night. This is what makes it interesting as it is impossible to perfectly complete this task, but with anaylitcs we can come closer than ever before.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset includes every MLB game in this season and includes all the factors that are used to predict the outcome probability. There is also a dataset that includes thousands and thousands of games from previous years as well. Factors that are included are the team rating and starting pitcher rating, along with how those two values effect the probability of the game. This dataset includes each ratings for before the game as well as after the game, which will be used for the future games in the attempt to become more and more accurate. In the last couple columns is the end result of each game that has concluded thus far in the season, meaning we can check and see how accurate this system has been in the first half of the season, which would give a strong idea on how accurate it should be for the second half.
